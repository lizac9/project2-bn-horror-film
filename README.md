## List of Features:
### Existing Features:

#### **Home section:**
 
This is the first part of the quiz the player will see when visiting. It is designed to allow the player to start playing the quiz with one click. The scores of the previous players can be seen from this window too. There is text describing the quiz in two fonts, the larger font is more stylised and displays the title of the quiz. The smaller font is more discrete and encourages the player to play the game by asking *“Are you ready to test your knowledge?”.*

#### **Game section:**
 
This section contains the quiz itself. The player is asked to answer 5 questions that are related to classic black and white horror films. Each question is randomly displayed from a list of pre-determined questions created from javascript. For each question, there is a multiple choice of four possible answers (A,B,C or D). There is progress bar that increases when the user is advancing through the questions. The score is displayed in the top right corner of the webpage.

## UI/UX:
### Site Goals:
The main goal is to test the knowledge of the users about black and white horror films. The interactive elements of this game are easily accessed by the player through a series of interactive boxes containing questions and answers. Each interactive button has a hover feature which allows the player to distinguish which box their cursor is on. Each question is displayed with 4 interactive boxes containing answers. When the player clicks an answer, a color change will occur - green indicates a correct answer and red indicates an incorrect answer. When the player has completed the quiz, an end game page will appear displaying the score. Through this page, users can save their score by entering their name. The option is given to the player to retake the quiz and improve their own personal knowledge.

### Desing Choices:

#### **Typography:**
The font ‘Bigelow Rules’ was chosen for the title, which welcomes the user to the game. My decision to use this font was influenced by the font used in the movie “The Nightmare Before Christmas”. It has an association with playful memories of childhood, and it sets a tone for the adventure the user is about to take. The body font is called ‘Wire One’. This font results in a more balanced and clear legibility for the remainder of the game. In the case that one of the other fonts can't be loaded, they will fall back to a sans-serif font.

#### **Colour Scheme:**
